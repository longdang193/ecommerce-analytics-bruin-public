-- MONITORING PATTERN NOTE: This is a distribution monitoring skeleton, not a production drift detector.
-- Each row represents one scoring batch (grouped by scoring_run_id), enabling comparison across runs.
-- Because the underlying feature population is static (same historical GA4 sample scored each run),
-- drift_score will be minimal or artificial in this MVP setup.
-- In production, compare mean_prediction / stddev_prediction against a baseline snapshot.
